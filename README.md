Twelf on Wasm
=============

[Twelf](http://twelf.org/wiki/Main_Page) is an implementation, in
[Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML), of a logical
framework base on the type theory LF.

Inspired by [Twelf Live](https://twelf-live.onrender.com), and thanks
to [this PR](https://github.com/MLton/mlton/pull/550) against the
MLTon compiler, which adds a cross-compilation target for Wasm/WASI,
you can now run twelf inside your browser.
