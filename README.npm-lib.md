Twelf on Wasm Support
=====================

This npm package `twelf-wasm` is a small library so that callers
(specifically the Twelf wiki) can conveniently construct url-fragment
arguments with the `encode` function so that they can link to
twelf-wasm and have it load a particular bit of twelf code at startup.

See the main README at https://github.com/jcreedcmu/twelf-wasm for
more details.
