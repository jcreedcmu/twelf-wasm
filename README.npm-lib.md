Twelf on Wasm Support
=====================

What we publish as an npm library as package `twelf-wasm` is just a
small library. The intended use is for libary users (specifically the
Twelf wiki) to conveniently construct url-fragment arguments with the
`encode` function so that they can link to twelf-wasm and have it load
a particular bit of twelf code at startup.
